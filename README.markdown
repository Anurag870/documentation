### ðŸš¨ Warning regarding PRs ðŸš¨

Our only major requirement for PR contributions is that the author responds to communication requests within a reasonable timeframe.

Once you've opened a PR on this repo, one of our team members will stop by shortly to review it. If your PR is approved, nothing further is required from you. However, if in seven days you have not responded to a request for further changes or more information, we will consider the PR abandoned and close it.

If this happens to you and you think there has been some mistake, please let us know and we will try to rectify the situation.

## Local development

### Requirements

- Node version >= v14 and <= v16

### Installing & Running

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:meilisearch/documentation.git meilisearch-documentation
# Open the newly created directory
cd meilisearch-documentation
# Install dependencies
yarn install
# Run Meilisearch documentation on http://localhost:8080
yarn dev
```

### Testing

A complete test can be done using the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

The tests are triggered on build and on any pull request to master.

#### Checking dead links

Making changes to the documentation without creating any dead links can be a tedious task. Before submitting any pull request, you can check the dead links.

```bash
yarn check-links
```

#### Checking Styling

The documentation follows styling rules. The following files will be checked: `*.vue`, `*.js`, and `*.md`.

You can check out and fix the styling errors.

```bash
yarn style:fix
```

You can test if the code is well-formatted without fixing it.

```bash
yarn style
```

### Deployment

The documentation is deployed as a static website. The master branch is automatically deployed at [https://docs.meilisearch.com](https://docs.meilisearch.com).

You can build the static website using the following command:

```bash
yarn build
# The website is now available in .vuepress/dist and you can serve it using any webserver.
```
